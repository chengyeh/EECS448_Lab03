        	<h2>Biography</h2>
        	<p>
        		&nbsp; Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of Joanna Lannister and Lord Tywin Lannister. 
        	    Tywin is the head of House Lannister, the richest man in the Seven Kingdoms and 
                Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. The Westerlands are one of the constituent regions
        	    of the Seven Kingdoms and House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses 
        	    of the realm. He is the younger brother of Jaime and Cersei Lannister. His mother Joanna
        	    Lannister died giving birth to him. His father and sister hold him in contempt as they
        	    blame him for the death.

        	<p>
        		&nbsp; He is a dwarf, causing him problems and persecution. His size has led him to being referred 
        		to derisively by various names, such as "the Imp" and "The Halfman". This is mitigated by 
        		his intellect and his family's wealth and power. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion 
        		been born a commoner, he'd have simply been left out in the woods to die. However, Tyrion 
        		was born into a powerful noble House, and was therefore spared. Even though his father doesn't 
        		think much of him, he has had the benefits of being raised with wealth and education, and is 
        		expected to lead his life as a credit to the Lannister name. He is committed to the good of 
        		both his House and, since Cersei married King Robert Baratheon, his family's continued hold 
        		on the throne.

    		<p>
    			&nbsp; Tyrion spends a lot of time at court in King's Landing to avoid his father. He gets on well 
    			with Jaime and his niece Myrcella and nephew Tommen, but has a colder relationship with Cersei 
    			and his sadistic nephew Joffrey. He has a fondness for prostitutes and drink, but is also intelligent, 
    			cunning, and educated. He also is a kind man who would protect the innocent claiming that he loves 
    			broken things.
